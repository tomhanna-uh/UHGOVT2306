## Tenth Amendment: State powers

Constitution of the United States: Amendment Ten

"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

                - Article II Powers of President
                - Article III Powers of the Courts

- Powers not prohibited to the States

<a href = "https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/767">Article I, Section 10</a>
        
Examples:

## Review of federalism.

- Sovereignty: Supreme power
- Unitary systems: Single, national government is sovereign
- Confederacy: state governments are sovereing, national government is dependent
- Federalism: Sovereignty is shared as defined by the Constitution
- Most of this is accomplished in Article I of the US Constitution
- Federalism is an additional part of Separation of Powers and a Check on federal power


## Evolution of Federalism

## Powers prohibited to Congress 

<a href = "https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-9/">Article 1, Section 9</a>

<a href = "https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/767">Article I, Section 10</a>

## States Rights: Bad phrasing

- Despite Northern states opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act

                - Virginia Resolution: Clarified concept of state as protector of citizen's rights

                - Strengthened opposition to Fugitive Slave Act


## Personal Liberty Laws and the Fugitive Slave Act: Background

- Mid-19th Century

- Context: Heightened tensions over slavery and states' rights.

- Fugitive Slave Act of 1850

                - Enforced return of escaped slaves, even in free states.
                - Required Free State Governments to Assist in the return of escaped slaves


## Northern Response: Personal Liberty Laws

- Purpose: Protect rights of free African Americans in free states.
- Provisions: Ensured trial by jury, restricted state officials' assistance.
- Supporters: Abolitionists and sympathetic Northerners.

## Impact and Legacy

- **Resistance to Federal Authority:** Asserted states' rights and resisted federal authority.
- **Contributed to Sectional Conflict:** Escalated tensions and contributed to the Civil War.
- **Symbol of Opposition:** Signified Northern resistance to slavery and federal enforcement.

## Important Point

Multiple impacts and unintended consequences

- Calhoun supported nullification but... 
- That nullification had nothing to do with slavery and...
- Nullification inspired the Personal Liberty Laws
- We can be fairly sure this is not what John C. Calhoun would have wanted 

## Civil War: Established Federal Supremacy

- Turning Point in question of state and federal power

- First Republican President: Abraham Lincoln

                - Lincoln's power: imposed martial law, imprisoned protesters, suspended habeas corpus
                - Lincoln's leadership: preserved the Union, Emancipation Proclamation
 
- Outcomes

                - Federal government's authority solidified
                - Railroads, tariffs, industrial development, westward expansion

## Westward Expansion: Increased Federal Power
