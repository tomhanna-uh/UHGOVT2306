## Announcements

- I am adding a "recommended schedule" for Chapter assignments in Canvas. This is only to help you meet the final deadline for the Unit. You should be finishing Chapter 4 Inquizitives this week. Chapter 5 due September 20..
- I will be sending reminders to those who are behind schedule from Canvas Gradebook. There is no need to reply to these.
-  Syllabus Quiz: Get Out of Jail Free supersedes Late Policy

                -  The correct answer for Question 10 "I didn't finish an assignment on time, I should?" should be: If it is my first missed assignment, I can use my Get Out of Jail Free Card to drop the grade. If I have already used my Get Out of Jail Free card, there are no extensions.
                
## Misinformation, Disinformation, and Information Consumers

- Information consumers: US! The people receiving and acting on the information
- Misinformation: false or misleading information that is unknowingly shared
- Disinformation: false or misleading information that is purposely created and distributed

                - Out of context: missing surrounding words and circumstances, real meaning may be the opposite
                - Unusual definitions: different meaning than normal speech of the *information consumer* 
                - Lies
                
## Three kinds of lies

**“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”** 

Attributed to:

                - Benjamin Disraeli
                - Mark Twain
                - Aldous Huxley
                - Leonard Henry, Baron Courtney of Penwith

## 55% of Budget for Defense

![55percent_defense meme](55percent_defense.jpg)

## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

![Tax Dollars Meme](tax_dollars_meme.jpg)

## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

- This meme purposely confuses two different things

Simple definitions:

                - Discretionary: set in every budget
                - Nondiscretionary: set far in advance
                - Total budget: Discretionary plus Nondiscretionary
                
- This shows only discretionary spending

                - Most spending on the little categories is nondiscretionary
                - Virtually all defense spending is discretionary

- If we show the total budget, the picture changes drastically
- If we show only nondiscretionary, the rocket disappears


## Why is this a problem?

"This week on Facebook I ran into a couple of memes about the defense budget that I thought were worth addressing. While the **core message that the United States spends too much on the military is sound**, these particular memes are so **massively misleading** that I think it would be irresponsible to let them go unanswered..."

"Our education spending is about average (though somehow we do it so inefficiently that we don’t provide college for free, unlike Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, or Norway)...How about a meme about that?"

## Practical and Moral Dimension

- Practical issue:

                - If you believe in something, is it better to make an honest argument that you can back up with facts or to resort to misinformation, disinformation, distortions, and lies?

                - What happens if someone arguing for something gets caught lying? What do the people listening think?
                
                - Which is more effective?
                
- Moral Dimension

                - Do you personally want to unknowingly spread disinformation?




<!-- ## Healthcare, Climate Change: Important Issues! -->



<!-- “We have a planetary crisis in terms of climate change. Our health care system is broken and dysfunctional. Our educational system is teetering. Our housing stock is totally inadequate. And these are just some of the crises facing our country,” [Senator Bernie Sanders] said. -->

<!-- - **Mostly true. A little exaggeration, but deserves discussion!** -->

<!-- - **How do you want to argue for these issues effectively?** -->

<!-- - **If you disagree, how do you want to respond?** -->

# Social Spending: Is this true?

Based on the budget, this isn't true at least for federal spending. 

Not based on private charitable spending *as a percent of national income* either [List of countries by charitable spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_charitable_donation_as_percentage_of_GDP)

“It just happens,” [Senator Bernie Sanders] said. “We don’t worry about people sleeping out on the street...”

TRUE MEME: We already spend $1,398 billion on healthcare. How much difference would $2 billion more make?
