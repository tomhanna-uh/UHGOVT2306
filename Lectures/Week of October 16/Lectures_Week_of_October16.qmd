        - Common in the United States
        - The winner take all aspect accounts for the dominance of two major parties
        - If there are a dozen closely matched candidates, the winner may only get 20% of the vote
        
- Majority system: candidate must win 50% + 1 vote
- Runoff election: if no candidate wins majority, top two candidates face off in a second election
- Ranked choice voting / instant runoff voting

        - voters rank candidates in order of preference
        - Uncommon now but used in the past in some major cities
        - Now used in Maine and Alaska for federal elections

        - Electors meet in December to cast their votes
        - Congress counts the Electoral College votes in January
        

- Indirect election of the chief executive is not unique to the United States
        
        - The Electoral College is unique to the United States

        - challengers: candidates running against incumbents
        
- Incumbents have name recognition and a record to run on
- Incumbents have access to campaign funds from PACs and other sources
