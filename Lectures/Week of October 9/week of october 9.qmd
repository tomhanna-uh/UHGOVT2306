## Martin Luther King, Jr.: Legacy

[From the Civil Rights Museum](https://www.civilrightsmuseum.org/dr-kings-legacy):

"Dr. King’s leadership contributed to the overall success of the civil rights movement in the mid-1900s and continues to impact civil rights movements in the present.

While King and other leaders generated momentous strides for equality, the push for civil rights remains a preeminent challenge today...

Dr. King’s generation did their part. Now, it’s time to do ours. The next generation needs us."
