While King and other leaders generated momentous strides for equality, the push for civil rights remains a preeminent challenge today...

Dr. King’s generation did their part. Now, it’s time to do ours. The next generation needs us."

# Local Houston Issue: Gunshot detection system

## GUnshot detection system and discrimination

Article: [ShotSpotter: The controversial technology that detects gunshots in Oakland](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/17/shotspotter-the-controversial-technology-that-detects-gunshots-in-oakland/)

- "ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection system that pinpoints where a gun was fired within 10 feet, has been used in Oakland since 2006. The technology is now in more than 90 cities across the country, including San Francisco, Richmond and Redwood City."

- It's been in Houston since 

## Report says Houston system is discriminatory

Article: [https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/doj-investigate-gunshot-detection-18406617.php](Controversial gunshot detection system violates Civil Rights Act: report)

## Complex issue

This is a complex issue

- EPIC
- Protection from gun violence
- Right to gun ownership - privilege and discrimination there?
- Areas of the city that need protection

## Issues

- Is the system effective? 
        
        - If not, Can it be effective?
        - Could the system save lives of gunshot victims? 
        
- Is the system discriminatory? 

        - Is it being deployed in a discriminatory manner? How should it be deployed?
        - Is it discriminatory by nature? If so, why?
        
- Who needs protection from gun violence most?
        
- Is it surveillance? Is it by its nature tyrannical? What other limits should there be if any?

## Issues: Effectiveness

- Is the system effective? 

- Can it be effective? What would it take?
        
- Could the system save lives of gunshot victims? 




## Issues: Discrimination


- Is it being deployed in a discriminatory manner? 
- How should it be deployed?
- Is it discriminatory by nature no matter where it is used? If so, why?

## Issues: Protection

- Who needs protection from gun violence most?

- One complaint is that this is being deployed in poor, minority neighborhoods, which raises the question:

**Is giving more protection to the privileged in their neighborhoods right?**

**Is giving protection to the poor and minorities from gun violence bad?**


## Issues: Surveillance

- Is it surveillance? 

- Is it by its nature tyrannical? 

- Is a system that triggers when a major, violent crime is committed the same as a system that records all activity?

- What other limits should there be if any?



# Public opinion and the Media


## Overview: Goal

- Understanding the media's and citizens' roles in a democracy
- Understanding the consequences of limiting expression
- **Critically considering the issue for yourself**

## Overview: Questions

- Why do we need free expression?
- How should we deal with "bad" opinions?
- Does freedom of the press only protect the large corporate media?
- What about citizen journalism?
- Is the internet speech or press or neither (and subject to regulation)?


## Free expression

- marketplace of ideas

## Free expression

- marketplace of ideas
- discussion and ballots are better than bullets

## Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis

**“If there be a time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” **





## Free expression

- marketplace of ideas
- discussion and ballots are better than bullets
- truth will win out / "bad" ideas will be defeated by "good" ideas





Are some ideas so bad they shouldn't be expressed?

## Issues with limiting expression

- Lose the value generated by testing good ideas against bad ones


## Issues with limiting expression

- Lose the value generated by testing good ideas against bad ones
- How do we decide what ideas are too bad to even be expressed?

## Issues with limiting expression

- Lose the value generated by testing good ideas against bad ones
- How do we decide what ideas are too bad to even be expressed?
- Who decides? Who is "the decider?"

## Issues with limiting expression

- Lose the value generated by testing good ideas against bad ones
- How do we decide what ideas are too bad to even be expressed?
- Who decides? Who is "the decider?"
- How is it possible to limit the power of the government to limit expression? How can we limit "the decider" if the decider can prevent us from discussing limits?




## Who gets to speak and write?

- Should it be limited to the corporate media?
- What about citizen journalism?

## Barack Obama

"As we do every time this year, Presidents and Prime Ministers converge on this great city to advance important work. But as leaders, we are not the most important people here today. It is the civil society leaders who, in many ways, are going to have the more lasting impact, because as the saying goes, **the most important title is not president or prime minister; the most important title is citizen."**

- My edit: the most important title isn't president or prime minister or *journalist*; the most important title is citizen
