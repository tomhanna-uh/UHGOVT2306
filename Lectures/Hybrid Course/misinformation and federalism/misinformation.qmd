## Misinformation, Disinformation, and Information Consumers

- Information consumers: US! The people receiving and acting on the information
- Misinformation: false or misleading information that is unknowingly shared
- Disinformation: false or misleading information that is purposely created and distributed

                - Out of context: missing surrounding words and circumstances, real meaning may be the opposite
                - Unusual definitions: different meaning than normal speech of the *information consumer* 
                - Lies
                
## Three kinds of lies

**“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”** 

Attributed to:

                - Benjamin Disraeli
                - Mark Twain
                - Aldous Huxley

## 55% of Budget for Defense

![55percent_defense meme](55percent_defense.jpg)

## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

![Tax Dollars Meme](tax_dollars_meme.jpg)

## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

- This meme purposely confuses two different things

Simple definitions:

                - Discretionary: set in every budget
                - Nondiscretionary: set far in advance
                - Total budget: Discretionary plus Nondiscretionary
                
- This shows only discretionary spending

                - Most spending on the little categories is nondiscretionary
                - Virtually all defense spending is discretionary

- If we show the total budget, the picture changes drastically
- If we show only nondiscretionary, the rocket disappears


## Why is this a problem?

"This week on Facebook I ran into a couple of memes about the defense budget that I thought were worth addressing. While the **core message that the United States spends too much on the military is sound**, these particular memes are so **massively misleading** that I think it would be irresponsible to let them go unanswered..."

"Our education spending is about average (though somehow we do it so inefficiently that we don’t provide college for free, unlike Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, or Norway)...How about a meme about that?"

[Human Economics](https://patrickjuli.us/2015/09/30/how-not-to-talk-about-the-defense-budget/)

## Practical and Moral Dimension

- Practical issue:

                - If you believe in something, is it better to make an honest argument that you can back up with facts or to resort to misinformation, disinformation, distortions, and lies?

                - What happens if someone arguing for something gets caught lying? What do the people listening think?
                
                - Which is more effective?
                
- Moral Dimension

                - Do you personally want to unknowingly spread disinformation?




<!-- ## Healthcare, Climate Change: Important Issues! -->



<!-- “We have a planetary crisis in terms of climate change. Our health care system is broken and dysfunctional. Our educational system is teetering. Our housing stock is totally inadequate. And these are just some of the crises facing our country,” [Senator Bernie Sanders] said. -->

<!-- - **Mostly true. A little exaggeration, but deserves discussion!** -->

<!-- - **How do you want to argue for these issues effectively?** -->

<!-- - **If you disagree, how do you want to respond?** -->

# Social Spending: Is this true?

Based on the budget, this isn't true at least for federal spending. 

Not based on private charitable spending *as a percent of national income* either [List of countries by charitable spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_charitable_donation_as_percentage_of_GDP)

“It just happens,” [Senator Bernie Sanders] said. “We don’t worry about people sleeping out on the street...”

![Balls within a ball](balls_within_ball.jpg)


## Three meanings of state

- A reference to any government as "the state"
- Any of the independent sovereign actors in the international system. A sovereign government such as a nation like France or an independent city-state like Singapore
- A subdivision in a federal or confederal system like the United States



 
## Unitary systems

- National government is supreme and holds all sovereignty

- Do they have lower level governments? (States, cities, etc.)

                - Yes! But those governments get their power solely from the national government and the national government can abolish the lower units, change their powers, or overrule decisions at any time.
                
- Most countries are unitary states 

                - 166 of 193 United Nations Members                

- Examples:

                - People's Republic of China
                - Republic of China (Taiwan)
                - France
                - Finland
                - Sweden
                
## Confederation

- The states are completely sovereign 

- The sovereign units  may be called states, republics, kingdoms, principalities, or other names associated with *sovereign states*

- Also called a *confederacy* or a *league*

- Is there a central or national  government? 

                - Yes! But the national government gets it power solely from the state governments and the state governments can abolish the central government, change its powers, ignore its decisions, or even overrule its decisions at any time.
                
- Examples:

                - Benelux states (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg)
                - European Union
                - Switzerland
                - Union State of Russia and Belarus
                - United Colonies of New England (1643-1689)
                - united States of America (1776-1789)
                - Confederate States of America
                - Commonwealth of Independent States (1991-??)
                
## Federalism

- Also called *federal systems* or *federalist systems*

- The central or national government is also called the *federal government*

- Sovereignty is shared between the state and national governments

                - The powers of state and national governments are defined in a constitution
                - The national government may not change the powers of the states
                - The state governments may not change the powers of the national government
                - Each level's powers are binding on the other in its own proper sphere of influence
                


## Federations (Federal systems)

- There are 27 federations in the world

- Examples:

                - Australia
                - Canada
                - Brazil
                - Estados Unidos Mexicanos
                - Germany
                - Russian Federation
                - United Arab Emirates
                
- and The United States of America

## How was power split?

- Federal government got necessary power for:

                - Interstate relations - common market

                - post offices and post roads
                - standard weights and measures
                - coin money and regulate the value of coin (currency)

- Westward expansion: increased federal power
- 1913 Federal Reserve Bank and Income Tax
