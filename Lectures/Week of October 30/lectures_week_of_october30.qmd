## Exam 2 Grades

- Announcement in Canvas with breakdown
- Slight decrease from Exam 1
- Almost everyone took the Exam

## Plan for Rest of Semester

- Estimating your grade:

        - If your Total Grade is 50 or below, please consider dropping this week
        - If you missed Exam 1, you can add 0.3 times your Exam 2 percentage for an estimate of your current grade without the online Deliberaion Activity
        - If you complete the Online Deliberation Activity, you can add 10 to your total grade for a good estimate of where you stand
        - So, if you have a 50, did not take Exam 1, made a 50% on Exam 2, and complete the Online Deliberation Activity, your estimated grade would be approximately 75.
        - If you have a 40, did not take Exam 1, made a 40% on Exam 2, and complete the Online Deliberation Activity, your estimated grade would be approximately 62%.
        - If you have a 30, did not take Exam 1, made a 30% on Exam 2, and do not complete the Online Deliberation Activity, your estimated grade would be approximately 39%.

## General Order #3

Galveston Texas June 19th 1865.

General Orders

     No. 3.

          The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.

               The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.

          By order of Major General Granger

                    F.W. Emery

                    Major A.A. Genl.
