## Announcements

- Exam 2 Grades
- Plan for rest of semester
- Final Exam Information
- Exam 2 Extra Credit

## Exam 2 Grades

- Announcement in Canvas with breakdown
- Slight decrease from Exam 1
- Almost everyone took the Exam

## Plan for Rest of Semester

- Estimating your grade:

        - If your Total Grade is 50 or below, please consider dropping this week
        - If you missed Exam 1, you can add 0.3 times your Exam 2 percentage for an estimate of your current grade without the online Deliberaion Activity
        - If you complete the Online Deliberation Activity, you can add 10 to your total grade for a good estimate of where you stand
        - So, if you have a 50, did not take Exam 1, made a 50% on Exam 2, and complete the Online Deliberation Activity, your estimated grade would be approximately 75.
        - If you have a 40, did not take Exam 1, made a 40% on Exam 2, and complete the Online Deliberation Activity, your estimated grade would be approximately 62%.
        - If you have a 30, did not take Exam 1, made a 30% on Exam 2, and do not complete the Online Deliberation Activity, your estimated grade would be approximately 39%.
